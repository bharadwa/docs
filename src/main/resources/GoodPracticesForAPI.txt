how the apis should be names
//REST stands for representational state transfer,
and it is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
All the api's should be structured around the resources in which they operate.
The type of action the api performs should't the part of the apis
example : /vedios/create is wrong
The type of action should be the part of the http method ,it shouldn't be the part of the api
different http methods are
GET --fetching a resource from the server
PUT --updating a resource on the server (completely updating the entire resource )
POST -- creating a new resource on the server
PATCH -- updating a resource partially on the server
DELETE -- deleting a resource from the server
no api shouldnt main any data from the previous api and it is called stateless
